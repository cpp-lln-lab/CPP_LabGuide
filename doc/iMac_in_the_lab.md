There are currently (update: July 2024) 4 iMacs in the lab.
If you want information about a computer or iMac in the lab, please consult this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5_rjj5mzXzh_8bLA_Rx3FmDdpYIUx2Y_z8SJPnKTHg/edit?usp=sharing).

It is good practice to create your own account on the computer in order not to install on the same account a different version of Matlab Tools.

All iMacs have an **admin** account. See the google scheet above for the passwords.
