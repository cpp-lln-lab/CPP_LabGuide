## How to write

8-week Coursera course on Writing in the Sciences (not a lot of work) (https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite)


## Reference management

Zotero (https://www.zotero.org/) is highly reccomended. 


## Naming convention for word documents

Just a few lines for outlining good practices when exchanging files for abstract or paper submission.
Here is the model we should use: `YourLastName_TargettedJournal/Conference_Date_InitialsPersonwhoCorrected`

### Examples
If David Bowie sent his last paper for the journal RollingStones on 06.08.18 and Olivier (Collignon) comments it the day after:
David sent: Bowie_RollingStones_18-08-06
Olivier sends back to David: Bowie_RollingStones_18-08-07_oc

If we got rejected and submit to MickeyMag few days after:
David sent: Bowie_MickeyMag_18-08-08
Olivier sends back to David: Bowie_MickeyMag_18-08-09_oc

If we dont know yet where to submit because we are out of options at the moment, this will be:
David sent: Bowie_InPrep_18-08-08
Olivier sends back to David: Bowie_InPrep_18-08-08_oc

For a conference / event (e.g. headlining Rock Werchter):
David sent: Bowie_Wechter_18-08-08
Olivier sends back to David: Bowie_Wechter_18-08-08_oc

This will massively help keeping track of things and avoid reading version that are not up to date.
