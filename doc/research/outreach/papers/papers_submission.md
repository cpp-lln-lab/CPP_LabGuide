# Publishing

## General information and tips 


## Pre-submission checklist

- [ ] is your data online and FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable)?
- [ ] is your code online and accessible?
- [ ] did you post a pre-print?
- [ ] did you update the CPP lab’s website with a link to the preprint? (check with Jacek)


## Post-acceptation checklist

Update: 
- [ ] the lab’s website
- [ ] research gate
- [ ] your ORCID account
- [ ] your DIAL account

But don't forget to also think of: 
- [ ] writing a press release (check with Olivier)
- [ ] social media thread (e.g twitter, bluesky) with the relevant hashtags and accounts (ADRE, UCLouvain, Louvain Bionics, IPSY, IONS)


## Open-access

Check the romeo database of journals to know the different journals policy regarding green, gold and other type of open access publishing.


## Pre-print

Make sure you put your paper on BioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/) or PsyArXiv (https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv) pre-print servers.
More and more journals are accepting them, but some dinosaurs are still reluctant about pre-prints. Check the journal guidelines before submitting.
In case you're asked to make many changes during the submission, or in case of a re-submission, you can also update your preprint. 
TIP: subscribe to the daily emails from Biorxiv, or follow them on twitter / bluesky, to keep up wiht the latest pre-prints in your field (this can be more than 6 months before the e-publication in a journal).


## Open-data platforms

### Generic
- GIN (https://gin.g-node.org/) is the platform mostly used in the lab to store havey datasets and analyses. We have a lab account, as well as a lab brewery for work-in-progress datasets.
- OSF (https://osf.io/) can be a valid alternative, mostly when you want to make your dataset public. 

### MRI - EEG 
- Openeneuro (https://openneuro.org/) for raw data sets organized as a Brain imaging data structure. It offers the possibility to run quality control (MRIQC) and preprocessing (fMRIprep) on the cloud. 
- Neurovault (https://neurovault.org/) for statistical maps at the group or individual level and for ROI


## DIAL "Digital access to libraries - Research Publications"

How to add your research production (publications/speech/poster/etc). on the online library: login here and follow these instructions.
In case of problems contact caroline.closset@uclouvain.be


## Press release / Communiqué de presse

It is always better, in UCLouvain, to send a communication in French to the francophone press, as it's more impactful. An Wnglish versionis however still helpful to have for the translated pages of the website.
