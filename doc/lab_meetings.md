## Journal club

They happen once a month, here you can propose and/or pick up a paper to be discussed.

## One slide meeting

The one slide meeting is once a month, the lab is divided in 3 batches [see here] and 1 batch will present alternatively.
Each person is invited to present for ~10 minutes 1 slide and the main goal is to update the lab about his/her scientific/project progress.

## Method meeting

A method meeting does not necessarily happen during the Lab Meeting (LM) schedule. It is called by someone who wants to discuss a specific topic that can be of interest for everyone or only a part of the lab (e.g. a software package, fMRI analysis, running a tutorial on how to use data management). Attending a method meeting is usually not mandatory if the topic is not of your interest.
