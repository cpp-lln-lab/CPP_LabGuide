# Testing participants

## General information

### Consent forms
The actual consent form depends on the ethics protocol of your project.

### Paying participants
Participants can be paid in cash by asking money in advance (“avance caisse”) to Isabelle Legrain. 
This system is based on asking for an advance, that will be deposited on your bank account, and from which you will pay yourself. It is very important that they fill the relative documents, to track and justify the expenses.   
At the end of the year (December) or when you finish the money, you will need to give all the forms to Isabelle Legrain to receive a new transfer.

### Recruiting of paticipants (standard populations)
You can post an announcement in the following Facbook groups: 
- 'Expériences indemnisées en Psycho (Pool participants UCL)' 
- 'Je fais avancer la science en passant des expériences rémunérées à l'ULB'
- [Expériences indemnisées à l'UCLouvain campus Woluwé-Saint-Lambert](https://www.facebook.com/groups/619418628169577/)

You can also contact Anne Wante (anne.wante@uclouvain.be) with the announcement of your experiment, she will share it with some students mailing list of IPSY (anne.wante@uclouvain.be)
Some students have to participate in experiments to obtain credits for some courses.

### Recruit of participants (special populations and relative controls) [WIP]
If you are testing special populations, we are setting up a system to track each subject and their relative controls. This is a Work In Progress. 
Anamsesi to administer (link): the anamnesis we used at the moment is this one. We can also use the first 4 pages of this anamnesis to assess the control subjects. 
Participant code rule (pseudocode): It is necessary to anonymize the participants' data, and to use a homogeneous code. One of the rules we can use is the following:  1st and 3d letters of the name and the surname of the mom’s participant_date of birth + 10 years. For instance, if my mom is named Marie Dubois and I am born in 1993, my code will be MADU_2003. 
OSF where we store anamnesi information (link): 
How to link Participant code and participant real name (link): 
Participant contacts (Cell phone, address, etc) (link):
Payment rules (transportation, lunch, experiment): Concerning the rules of payment of the participants, they must be discussed with Olivier (to pay or not the lunch, to reimburse all types of transport or only the public transport etc...). Once you know how much you are going to pay and on which account to charge it, you have to fill out some administrative paperwork. There are two options 1) You can ask the participant to fill in the document Demande de paiement.Then you bring it back to isabelle (gestionnaire comptable) specifying the account with which you want to pay and she will proceed to the payment via bank transfer. 2) The second preferred option is to complete the document Recu des participants. First, you must go to Isabelle to request an avance caisse, which means that she will transfer money directly into your personal bank account. Once you have the money, you ask the participant to fill out Recu des participants, and you can pay the money directly to the participant yourself (via bank transfert or cash). Then, you also have to bring this document back to Isabelle. If you have extra money from your study, you must of course return it to Isabelle. 
In any case, before launching your study, it is preferable to speak with Isabelle to choose the most suitable payment technique.

## MRI experiments

### In Saint Luc (Woluwé campus)
Most of the conversation about St.Luc, and relative documnets, can be found in the Discord channel (#return-of-the-gedi and #testing-stluc-mri).
THe important documents (Metal Check list, fMRI Checklist, Certified User exam sheet, and some pictures of which button does what) can also be found on google drive. 

#### General information about booking the scanner:
- fMRI can be booked for Neuroscience researchers (independent of the pandemic):
  - during the week days: Monday and Friday from 13:30 till 18:00 (the most expensive per hour cost)
  - during weekends: 09:00 till any (cheaper per hour cost)
  - any week day after 7pm booking is ALWAYS possible. 

- fMRI acquisition testing (pilots) are free up to 3 hours of booking. If it's DTI (e.g. complex acquisition) and therefore requires more testing, it has o be discussed. 

- Delays up to 15 min are accepted by all the researchers. For example, if researchers book from 1pm till 2pm, but delayed for some reason to 2:15pm, it's OK. They will be paying the time from 1-2pm. 

- Similarly, if one books a 13:30 session on a week day (either Monday or Friday), that is the arrival to the lab time. Someone from the previous session might be still working. The time to put participants inside the scanner would be 13:45. 

- If radiology or MRI lab related reasons the researcher cancels her session, e.g. sound system broken, ... the researcher will not pay for their lost or cancelled sessions. 

- Sessions can be cancelled without the loss of money 3 days in advance! 

- It's not possible to see the MRI booking calendar for privacy and several other reasons. The booking is always through Laurence Dricot. 

 
### In Liège - CRC

In general a lot of documents for the CRC are on their gitlab repo:

https://gitlab.uliege.be/CyclotronResearchCentre/

Some covid procedures

More details on the gitlab repo of the CRC
https://gitlab.uliege.be/CyclotronResearchCentre/Public/covid19
Tell us if you or your participants show ANY symptoms. Get in touch if the symptoms show soon after you have been at CRC
Stay at home if there is a risk.
Give your phone number to your participants so they can reach you in the building. Make sure they are on time they know ho they are supposed to be meeting with (to avoid letting randos in the CRC facility)
Participants should come alone (can be done differently with blind participants).
Make sure that you have some time gap between participants for cleaning everything.
Sign up in the log book when coming into the CRC

#### Booking the scanner

For 7T: see the CPP-lab 7TMRI user guide (Liege CRC-GIGA center)

#### Setup and scanning: checklist

Control room
- [ ] log book : mention when you turn on the machine
- [ ] turn on scanner (key next to quench button)
- [ ] turn on console: normal and pTX

Tech room
- [ ] turn on video projector (only use the remote control and do not touch the stand the projector is on to avoid moving it)
- [ ] plug in the eyetracker

Control room
- [ ] turn on eye-tracking computer
- [ ] turn on stim computer
- [ ] make sure that pulse oximeter and respiration belt remote interfaces are fully charged

Participants
- [ ] Change and metal check outside of the control room (on the right before entering the 7T area).
- [ ] Weight and height of participants for SAR
- [ ] Install in the scanner room:
  - [ ] respiration belt when standing
  - [ ] set padding under the head (unless you plan to use the di-electric pads then this might need to be done later)
  - [ ] set up headphones
  - [ ] participant lie down on table with head in the coil
  - [ ] plug in pulse oximeter and respiration belt to their remote: make sure you get a clear signal on the screen above the table
  - [ ] participant has the response pad (make sure they work)
  - [ ] participant has the alarm button 
  - [ ] all the cables are clear and won’t get caught in anything when you slide the participant in

Eyetracker
should be done with the light turned off to mimic the condition of acquisition.
- [ ] make sure you get good pupil and corneal signal

General steps
- [ ] Entering participant details 
- [ ] Shutting down
- [ ] Cleaning
