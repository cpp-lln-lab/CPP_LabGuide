## Transportation

### Commute Brussels-Louvain-la-Neuve
Try not to advance money when buying a subscription. First ask the UCL for the form to obtain the subscription and THEN buy it. Otherwise you might not get fully reimbursed.

You can ask veronique vanhoegaerden from UCL. 

If you're FNRS, contact Aurelie Volont to ask for the subscription: "Following the agreements with SNCB, it was agreed that the UClouvain could issue the form for obtaining the SNCB subscription. This ensures that the amount does not have to be advanced, since the invoice is sent directly to the FNRS.In this case the subscription is 100% refunded as it is the system of the paying third part of which 80% by the FNRS and 20% by the state. 
If the subscription has already been contracted or is only for STIB or TEC, De Lijn, without SNCB then the FNRS only reimburses 80% on the basis of proof of purchase."

### Train (SNCB)
The direct train from Brussels to LLN passes in these train stations: Midi, Centrale, Nord, Schuman, Luxembourg, Etterbeek.

> [!WARNING]
> A lot of delays and sometimes change of platforms - always check the SNCB app

#### Train Tickets for under the age of 26
For people who are under 26, there is a Youth Ticket, which allows you to travel anywhere in Belgium for €7.50 per journey. But be careful that it is economical for only long distances, like going to Brugges from Louvain-la-neuve. For short distances, standart ticket may be more economical than the youth ticket. 

Also, there is %50 discount in the standart ticket on the weekends! 
> [!NOTE]
> **If you are coming in the summer period,** which starts from 1st July to 1st September, you can buy a monthly ticket allowing you unlimited traveling anywhere in Belgium for €35. 
**If you are coming in the school period,** and you have the student document for transportation (certificate of provisional registration), you can buy an abonnement between two stations (e.g. LLN-Brussels zone). Be aware that it is not the same ticket as the summer period, it is only valid between stations that you choose. 
### BUS (TEC)
There is a direct bus from Etterbeek station and Roodebeek Station. 

> [!TIP]
> If you are confused with which ticket to buy, be aware that the bus ticket for going between Brussels and LLN is the express one, which is €5. 

#### BRUSSELS - LLN by bus and train
The easiest neighbourhoods in Brussels to reach LLN by train are in the south-east part of the city (Ixelles/Etterbeek/Schuman). 
There is also a bus (E11) going from Delta (neighborhood Auderghem/watermael-Boitsfort) to LLN in 35min
Or a bus (E12) going from Woluwé (Roodebeek/Stockel/Alma) to LLN in 30min.

## Accommodation
The first choice is where do you want to settle in? Most typical options are Brussels, Louvain la Neuve, Wavre, Namur, etc... Most of the people in the group live in Bruxelles. Talk to the lab members about this to have their opinions!
If you are looking to rent your own place, try http://www.immoweb.be. You can filter by location, price, as well as "furnished" or "unfurnished". Note that if you take an unfurnished flat it's common to have absolutely NOTHING in it. No blinds, no light fixtures, potentially no kitchen! Note that kitchens are often described as “semi-equipped” or “hyper-equipped”, this refers to what type of appliances are there (dishwasher, fridge, etc).

### Temporary accommodation
First of all, check the UCLouvain webpage for accommodation: https://uclouvain.be/en/study/logement-0.html You can see lots of options there. 

[http://koterasmus.be/](https://koterasmus.be/) This is a group of students that are living together and share the project of welcoming, gathering and helping exchange students coming on the campus of Louvain-la-Neuve. Currently it doesn't seem very active though. 


#### LOUVAIN-la-NEUVE
If you want to benefit from a university accommodation, you have to make the request as soon as possible since they are always full. Ideally, for a start in September, the request should be done in March/April before starting. If you come from abroad the accommodation service of the university may ask for a contract that you don't have yet. In such a situation, ask Olivier to send a recommendation letter explaining you will be hired by providing the details and motivation, this may help unlock the situation.

If you are coming for a short-term like 2-3 months, you should email them at least 1 or 1.5 months before arriving in Belgium to reserve a room. They answer very late sometimes, but if they don't answer for 1-2 weeks, send more emails highlighting that it's urgent.
