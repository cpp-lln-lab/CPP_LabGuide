We are trying to update the website periodically in a few main cases

## [PEOPLE](https://cpplab.be/people)
If you are joining the lab long-term(ish), please make sure that you are listed on the website with a short description on what you do. 
If you are short-term intern, please make sure that you are listed in the relevant section. 

Have your picture, funding source, short description and links to science socials ready (Twitter, Research Gate or Google Scholar)!

## [PUBLICATIONS](https://cpplab.be/publications)
Have you published a paper or a preprint? Let’s put it on the website with links to pdf (we can upload the pdf directly to the website too)
If it's a published paper, have a pdf ready!

## [TALKS](https://cpplab.be/talks)
have you presented your research in the form of a talk or a lecture? Let me know!
Have the exact title, occasion, location and date ready! If it’s available online, have the link ready too!

## [NEWS](https://cpplab.be/news)
Currently, we are mainly posting news about new papers (1 figure from the paper + abstract so not much work neeed from the authors), 
but this section could be refreshed a bit with information about what’s happening in the lab (people joining, leaving, new PhD / MA defenses, Guests from other labs etc.).
