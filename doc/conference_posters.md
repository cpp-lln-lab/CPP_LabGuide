# Conference posters
Here's some useful tools for whne you are desining a new conference poster. 

## Templates and logos
In the shared google drive we have a [folder with poster templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e7-B4K2QuL-Q6hSJn0pEHg_Q7SgRSYad). 
There you can find powerpoint templates and logos of the main institutions and fundings. 

## Examples of posters from the lab
In this other [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s5D3lUjc_yjl-tU8ExhMbruQay83ggF8) there are some (old) posters from lab members that can be used as source of inspiration.
