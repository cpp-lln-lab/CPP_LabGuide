# Purchasing guidelines in the lab


## Buying a computer


- Step 1: Before proceeding, discuss your computer needs and financial options with Olivier.
- Step 2: Choose your desired specifications and options from the appropriate website (e.g., Apple). It is also good to ask your lab mates what specs could be important not to overlook.

- Step 3: Save a PDF of the detailed quote or invoice (with all specifications) and send it to Roland Jaumain (roland.jaumain@uclouvain.be). He will look for available university discounts and provide a final invoice to you and Olivier.
- Step 4: After acceptance, upload the final invoice to the Lab Drive folder under Main/Computers/Computers, to keep track of all computer purchases.  
Take into account that after purchase, the **delivery can take 5 to 8 weeks**.

## Buying any other items

You might need to buy other material during your time in the lab, such as hard drives and IT accessories, office supplies, specific cables, materials for experiments, ...

By default, you always need to **buy via official provider** :

- [Lyreco](https://www.lyreco.com/webshop/FRBE/index.html)
- [Redcorp](https://www.redcorp.com/)

*There might be other official providers.*

If the item you are looking for, or an alternative, isn't available through any official provider, you can purchase on the website of your own choice. However, **always refer to Isabelle** before purchasing to ensure you will be reimbursed.
