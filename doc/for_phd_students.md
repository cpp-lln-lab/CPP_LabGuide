Before enrolling in a course, you might want to double-check the prerequisites for the courses/credits with your doctoral school and the person of reference (for Psychological Sciences: Martine Janssens, for Biomedical School: Sandrin Wollanders).

**Careful**: some courses have a limit for attendance and you might want to enrol in time.

# Defending the PhD (IPSY rules)

Each doctoral student in IPSY has a thesis budget to cover some of the expenses (according to certain rules).

## Rules as of June 2023:

There is indeed an envelope of 881 € per PhD student which will be distributed/used as follows: 

> 250 €: Maximum lump sum paid by the faculty for printing. This amount has been calculated to cover the printing of copies for a jury. No expenses above this budget will be reimbursed by the faculty. You can choose where to print. For instance, for approx. 200 pages, with 30 in colours, CIACO charges 35 EUR per copy. FACOPY 17 EUR.
> 150 €: Maximum amount for the organisation of the drink after the public defence. You can buy your own drinks/chips or ask Siegrid to take care of it.

No expenses above this budget will be reimbursed by the faculty. 

Any balance will be paid by the doctoral student; 


The balance of the "thesis" budget can be used for :

> Possible travel of jury members 
> reservation of train, plane, hotel, etc. 
> printing the draft thesis, sending the thesis to the jury members, etc.
The doctoral student must pay particular attention to the following guidelines: 
### Practical organisation: travel of a jury member, travel, etc. 
> The IPSY Secretary 
### Budget, reimbursements, balance and amounts available 
> The CLC IPSY manager, my colleague Mr Achraf TSSICHE 
### Format, layout, etc.
