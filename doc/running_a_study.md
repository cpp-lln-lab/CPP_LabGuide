We ask researchers to present their project before acquiring any data (some piloting still possible as this can help prepare the project itself).  We don't veto projects but it happened (rarely) that we asked the project carrier to provide further explanations.

I see this as a "pre-review" process where we try to ensure that you will be able to answer your scientific question with the data you plan to acquire. This is not a bullet proof process but we hope that if there were some weak points in the experimental design and/or data processing plan, these would be spotted before it's too late. It can also highlight what's possible, or not, and refocus the project to a clear(er) achievable goal. Finally later on, it can be used as a guideline for "what to do next". Afterwards, it'll be down to you to follow the plan, your plan! :-)

All in all, my 2 favourite questions are:
- what is your fundamental scientific questions?
- If you were given the whole data set tomorrow, what would you do exactly with them?
Colleagues with different backgrounds have their own little quirks. So be prepared. 

We have prepared 2 templates, see attached:
- the "project presentation" (PPt), to be adapted for the team presentation
- the "project study" document (MarkDown), for a more complete and technical description.
Feel free to adapt. The latter one can be completed at a later stage too.
