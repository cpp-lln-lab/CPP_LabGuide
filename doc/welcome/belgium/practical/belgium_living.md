# Find an accomodation

The first choice is where do you want to settle in? Most typical options are Brussels, Louvain la Neuve, Wavre, Namur, etc... Most of the people in the group live in Bruxelles. Talk to the lab members about this to have their opinions!

If you are looking to rent your own place, try http://www.immoweb.be. You can filter by location, price, as well as "furnished" or "unfurnished". Note that if you take an unfurnished flat it's common to have absolutely NOTHING in it. No blinds, no light fixtures, potentially no kitchen! Note that kitchens are often described as “semi-equipped” or “hyper-equipped”, this refers to what type of appliances are there (dishwasher, fridge, etc).

Some other websites to check if you are looking for a room/apartment where to live either in Brussels or in Louvain-la-Neuve:

## Short-term accommodation

First of all, check the [UCLouvain webpage](https://uclouvain.be/en/study/logement-0.html) for accommodation. You can see lots of options there. 

[http://koterasmus.be/](https://koterasmus.be/) This is a group of students that are living together and share the project of welcoming, gathering and helping exchange students coming on the campus of Louvain-la-Neuve.


## Where to find an accomodation

### Brussels
The easiest neighbourhoods in Brussels to reach LLN by train are in the south-east part of the city (Ixelles/Etterbeek/Schuman).  
There is also a bus (E11) going from Delta (neighborhood Auderghem/watermael-Boitsfort) to LLN in 35min  
Or a bus (E12) going from Woluwé (Roodebeek/Stockel/Alma) to LLN in 30min. 

### Louvain-la-Neuve
If you want to benefit from a university accommodation, you have to make the request as soon as possible since they are always full. Ideally, for a start in September, the request should be done in March/April before starting. If you come from abroad the accommodation service of the university may ask for a contract that you don't have yet. In such a situation, ask Olivier to send a recommendation letter explaining you will be hired by providing the details and motivation, this may help unlock the situation. If you have decided on your arrival date soon, send an e-mail to the logement administration as soon as possible.

## Registration at the commune

- You probably already have a Visa issued by the Belgian Embassy in your country. This visa allows you to enter Belgium, but it is not the same as a residence permit. You have to register at the local authorities (called "the commune") to receive your residence permit. The duration of the residence permit is typically tied to your UCL work contract (e.g., 2 years).

- On the side note: If you are already residence in any EU countries but you are not EU citizen, you do not need to apply for a visa. When you arrive to Brussels you can directly apply for residence permit. You have 3 months time to apply for this residence permit. (Your residence permit from another EU country is valid for 3 months in Belgium)

- You will need to visit the foreigners office in your local commune within eight days of arriving in Belgium. Note that different areas of Belgium are governed by different communes – there is one for Ottignies-Louvain la Neuve, one for Bruxelles, one for Ixelles, etc. Go to the one that is for your area!

- To register at the commune you will need: Your identification (passport), about 5-8€, some passport size photos of yourself, your work contract, proof of your address (ideally a lease contract), and your legalised marriage certificate if you have one.

- After your initial registration at the commune, they will send a police officer to your residential address to check that you really live there. They usually will not fix a time for this, it’s random. If there are other people living there, explain to them that this is happening and they can try to vouch for you if you are not in the house when the police come. Once you are confirmed to be living there, they will send a letter with the PIN/PUK codes for your card to that address. You go back to the commune with this letter and collect your card. The whole process takes about four weeks at least…
