# Belgian transportation

## Public transport in Brussels

Add section about STIB, and beware of strikes and delays.

### How to get a pass (if you're eligible)
- If you need to use public transport to get to UCL, the university will cover the cost of your travel subscription if you have FNRS or FSR grant (“Frais de déplacement” - http://www.uclouvain.be/357050.html ). Note that not all the grants cover the cost of travel subscription (e.g., WBI grant). Make sure you know in advance which is your particular case.
More information can be found on: https://intranet.uclouvain.be/fr/myucl/travailler/frais-de-deplacements-domicile-lieu-de-travail-0-1.html
The dedicated email address to ask questions about it is: remuneration@uclouvain.be
-	It will typically be either the train SNCB network or the bus TEC network. Best to ask a French speaking lab member to help you with this. Normally, the university will automatically get you a year-subscription, so you may encounter problems if you have to change the type of subscription in the middle of the year (for instance, changing the train season ticket to a bus season ticket).


## Public transport in Belgium (and abroad)

### Commute Brussels-Louvain-la-Neuve
Try not to advance money when buying a subscription. First ask the UCL for the form to obtain the subscription and THEN buy it. Otherwise you might not get fully reimbursed.

You can ask Veronique Vanhoegaerden (veronique.vanhoegaerden@uclouvain.be) from UCL. 

If you're FNRS, contact Aurelie Volont (aurelie.volont@uclouvain.be) to ask for the subscription: "Following the agreements with SNCB, it was agreed that the UClouvain could issue the form for obtaining the SNCB subscription. This ensures that the amount does not have to be advanced, since the invoice is sent directly to the FNRS.In this case the subscription is 100% refunded as it is the system of the paying third part of which 80% by the FNRS and 20% by the state. 

If the subscription has already been contracted or is only for STIB or TEC, De Lijn, without SNCB then the FNRS only reimburses 80% on the basis of proof of purchase."

!!! WARNING
      Delays and platform changes can happen frequently so always check the SNCB app while traveling

#### Train Tickets for under the age of 26
For people who are under 26, there is a Youth Ticket, which allows you to travel anywhere in Belgium for €7.50 per journey. But be careful that it is economical for only long distances, like going to Bruges from Louvain-la-neuve. For short distances, standart ticket may be more economical than the youth ticket.
