# Belgian bureaucracy

## Bank account

Generally, Belgian banks require your Belgian ID card to create an account. But upon request and prior inquiry they can create an account using your passport (example, AXA bank). 

Another option is to use digital banks like N26.


## Health care

How your healthcare is managed in Belgium depends on whether you are a citizen of the European union or not (see more information here). You will likely need to join a mutualité, who will administer the partial refund of your medical care. They all offer the same essential service – you submit your consultation and medication receipts to them and they refund you the amount you should get back from the government. Each also offers its own additional package which gives you some additional cover (for an extra premium of course!). Every time you visit a healthcare provider, keep all your receipts! Note that some providers will definitely charge more than the government will refund. Choose carefully.

### Getting appointments GP
specialist, maison du medicale, …

Best practice is to have a dedicated GP. (to have a centralised place for medical records (upon request)+ for regular prescriptions + will refer you to specialists if needed)

One of the ways is you can check this website to look for a GP in your area or preferred area: https://www.doctoranytime.be/

Another option, ask in the Lab someone might have a good GP to recommend. 

### Psychological Help
in Brussels or elsewhere

- Your GP can recommend someone.

## Stay Permit

Information regarding stay permit (for stays more than 3 months/90 days) can be found here : https://www.commissioner.brussels/en/i-am-an-expat/residence-formalities/non-ue-citizen/79-residence-formalities-non-ue/85-more-than-90-days

Easy way to understand this procedure: ( from a PhD student's experience, should be similar for a post Doc but best to double check )

- When you arrive in Belgium and have figured out your housing/accommodation, medical insurance, bank account, phone number etc. You are required to contact your commune/local municipality to register your arrival and long term stay. Better to do it as soon as possible, by law within 90 days or till your visa is valid. Also good to remember you will be dealing with bureaucracy! Might take a while to get the appointment.
  
- Every commune has a foreigners office, where you must show up (after setting up an appointment by call or email) with required documents (listed on your commune's website).  
Note: All information for making appointments will be listed on your commune's website.
- Example of a generic list of documents: (but please cross check with your commune as well to have complete information.)
      1. Passport
      2. Passport size photos. 
      3. Accommodation/housing contract.
      4. University Registration (for the current year).
      5. Proof of salary/grant.
      6. Proof of medical insurance (ask your insurance provider).
      7. 25 euros (for registration + stay permit card. It's mandatory)

- List of documents for Stay Permit application and related information: https://dofi.ibz.be/fr/themes/ressortissants-dun-pays-tiers/etudes

- Immediately at the end of your first appointment, you will be given an Appendix 15. This paper will act as a "temporary" stay permit till you receive the stay permit card. (Which can take max 2-3 weeks)
- Appendix 15 doesn't have schengen status. Best not to travel outside Belgium with just your passport + Appendix 15. 
- Your stay permit will have the schengen status.
