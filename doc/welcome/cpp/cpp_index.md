# Welcome to CPP-Lab

## Lab website

Most information can be found directly on the [lab website](https://cpplab.be). How to use it and to update it is explained in the "Life in the Lab" section. 


## Lab meetings

We have regular lab meetings, weekly on Thursday (apart from particular exceptions). In the "Life in the Lab" section, you can find detailed information about what to expect and how to approach them. 


## Important links

Getting started can take a bit of time, with all the information you have to absorb. In the "important links" section, you can find all the platforms used by the lab (e.g. google calendars for meetings and testing, discord to communicate with lab members, mailing lists, etc.)
