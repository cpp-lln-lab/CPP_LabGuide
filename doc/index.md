# CPP Lab Guide

Welcome to the Crossmodal Perception and Plasticity (CPP) Lab!


## FAQ

Here's a few common questions that can help you use this guide. [WIP]

### How to navigate this guide?
The guide is divided in three main sections: 

1. Welcome - mostly for newcomers to get acquainted to the lab and the place
2. Life in the lab - for daily problems that are not related to the research
3. Research - for sciency stuff and for tips about science outreach

If you are starting in the lab, we reccommend to check out sections 1 and 2 first, to get a hang of what you need to kick-start your time in the lab. 
If you have a specific question, the subsections will help you find your answer. 

### Why is it mostly empty?
The whole guide is a work in progress. It started from a old obsolete gdoc file and we are now trying to imporve it and expand it. 

### There is an empty section that I urgently need. What do I do? 
To get your answer in quickly, it's better to contact lab members directly as the guide may take a bit of time to have all the information. Once you find your answer, please get in touch to contribute it to the guide, so the next person will not have your same problem.

### There is an empty section that I could fill with information. How do I do? 
Check out how to contribute below.
