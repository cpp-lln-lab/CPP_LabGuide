Follow this link for the service of inscription either at louvain-la-neuve (doctoral school ipsy) or wolluwe (doctoral school science biomedical): https://uclouvain.be/en/study/inscriptions/contacts.html 2. get your PhD proposal approved by the \u201ccommission doctoral\u201d (CDD ; secretary is Martine JANSSENS). The CDD meets once a month so make sure to time things appropriately. 3. get enrolled at UCL (this requires to get the green light from B) to be finalized but you can start this ASAP anyway) (person to get in touch with: Mila Mihaylova ; Service du personnel, Place de l\u2019universite if you enroll at Doctoral school in psychology; ) 4. for our payments (bourse / scholarship) you might need to bring some additional papers (most of them should be in the annexe.zip in CPP-Lab_SharedFolder(LLN)\\WelcomeinBelgium) to Lorraine Jacob (Service du personnel, Place de l\u2019universite).

Once you have the money, you ask the participant to fill out Recu des participants, and you can pay the money directly to the participant yourself (via bank transfert or cash).
