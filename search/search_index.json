The CDD meets once a month so make sure to time things appropriately. 3. get enrolled at UCL (this requires to get the green light from B) to be finalized but you can start this ASAP anyway) (person to get in touch with: Mila Mihaylova ; Service du personnel, Place de l\u2019universite if you enroll at Doctoral school in psychology; ) 4. for our payments (bourse / scholarship) you might need to bring some additional papers (most of them should be in the annexe.zip in CPP-Lab_SharedFolder(LLN)\\WelcomeinBelgium) to Lorraine Jacob (Service du personnel, Place de l\u2019universite).
